# TMUX Configuration

My Tmux configuration with theme plugin and optional custom styling (commented)

If a new Theme is sourced it is NOT attached to all current buffers. Only for new Sessions, changed theme is loading.

# Requirements

Clone Plugin Repo `git clone https://github.com/jimeh/tmux-themepack.git ~/.tmux-themepack`

Clone Plugin Manager for Tmux `$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`

While in tmux session, press `prefix + I` (capital i, as in Install) to download and install plugins.

Save session with `prefix + strg + s`
Restore session with `prefix + strg + r`

## Currently used theme in config file:
